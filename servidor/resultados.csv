friends were going into the service Ö So I finally volunteered for induction Ö I couldnít Ö They wanted me to stay and work at Sun Strands Ö But I felt like I Ö Well I just felt like I should go into the service Ö So I volunteered for induction in 1940 Ö April of 44 I believe it was I went in Ö So Ö You went overseas then Ö Yes Ö I went over in Italy at the time Ö You volunteered for the ski troops Ö Yes I volunteered and I wanted to get into ski troops and Ö Ski troops Ö Yes at the time I wanted Ö We used to ski Ö I loved to ski Ö So Ö At the time the 10th Mountain Division had already left Ö And gone overseas Ö So I was an infantry rifleman until I got over into Italy Ö And over there I volunteered to get into the ski troops Ö So I got into the ski troops over in Italy Ö And of course the war was over in 1945 Ö July I guess I Ö May it was over but July of 45 I shipped home Ö And I was going to go over to Japan Ö And during my overseas furlough the war was over there too Ö So I Ö I stayed in the army until I was discharged Ö May of 46 Ö Yes May of 46 Ö So you came back without a scratch then Ö Oh yes Ö How about your brother was he also Ö No he didnít go in Ö He was Ö A little higher up in Ö Sun strands a little more Ö What do I say Ö Chief engineer Ö Chief engineer at the time yes Ö So that they couldnít afford to let him go Ö So were you married then Ö Did you rent an apartment then or how did you Ö Well we rented a little bungalow Ö A little house at the time Ö And Ö A new little house in the army of course Ö Yes Ö And I remember the first year Ö 1942 it was a winter Ö It snowed I think every day Ö And of course we had gas rationing at the time because of the war Ö And we got Ö I forget what it was four gallons Ö Three gallons a week Ö And we saved that because we lived a little bit outside of town Ö We saved that for our shopping on Saturday Ö So I would ski to work every morning Ö All winter long I would just put on my skis and ski to work and Ö In the summer time I got a bicycle and Ö Bicycle to work Ö Was that your dad that got you into skiing or Ö No I just took it up by myself Ö Did you play soccer Ö No I didnít play soccer Ö Basketball I guess Ö Oh yeah I belonged to a Swedish gym Ö I did weight lifting and Ö And tumbling and Ö Swedish gym troop Ö So for quite a few years Ö So there were a lot of people interested in Ö There was a lingy gymnastic Ö Who was the leader at that time when you Ö In your thirties Ö Erik Johnson was Ö Heís a Tida Holmberg Ö And he passed away here last year Ö So Ö He was the director or leader of the Ö Of the gym troop Ö But Ö How many were you then at your time Ö There were quite a few Ö I donít recall the exact number Ö What would be Ö Thirty Ö Thirty or forty I suppose in the whole gym Ö Did you register every week Ö I was more Ö I did more weight lifting and Ö Workouts than in the tumbling Ö So Ö My brother was Ö On the tumbling team I believe Ö The Ö And they put on a show once Ö A year I guess Ö How often did you practice down Ö Oh I went down there Ö Several times during the week Ö Maybe three times a week Ö And there was located Ö Third Avenue Ö Right between Ö Sixth and Seventh Street was it Ö Right Ö Smackdown town Ö So there was Ö A busy place then for Ö Oh sure Ö There were a lot of people Ö There in the thirties because Ö Many of them were out of work and Ö They had to spend time Ö Doing something Ö Yeah Ö Iíd say back in the late thirties Ö The depression was over then Ö And most of the people were working Ö It was Ö Early thirties Ö That the depression Ö There werenít too many people working in Ö I guess up until 1930 Ö Four or five Ö If you really wanted a job Ö You could get one like I say Ö For eight or ten cents an hour Ö So Ö The generation after you then Ö Or Ö I mean Ö They were born in the thirties and the forties Ö They did not become interested in gymnastics Ö And athletics Ö Not as much Ö Why was that Ö In that respect Ö I guess they had other interests then Ö I Ö Like the soccer for instance Ö They didnít Ö They died out during the forties Ö More or less didnít they Ö Really never Ö Yeah Ö Well my father was on a soccer team Ö See back Ö Back the Ö In the twenties Ö Original Swedes back in the teens Ö Back before the twenties even Ö There were soccer teams Ö But I donít think there was any soccer Ö That I remember when Ö It was Ö He never tried to get you interested in soccer Ö No Ö He got me interested in gymnastics Ö Walking on my hands and Ö Tumbling Ö Things like this Ö In school it was football Ö Here in school it was football and basketball and baseball Ö So Ö But Ö So the school was stronger Ö To convince the young people to do that Ö Yeah Ö And there was no soccer in the schools Ö No Ö Itís just coming back right now Ö I think Ö Theyíre finally getting into soccer Ö But Ö Up until a couple of years ago Ö There was no soccer being played in Ö In this area Ö So they died out for a while then Ö Yeah Ö Football and baseball is the big thing I guess Ö Were you interested in baseball Ö Also Ö I played it at home with the kids Ö I played basketball on a team Ö But Ö Thatís about it Ö I Ö When I went to
